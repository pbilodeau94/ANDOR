  MOGAD:
    'MOGAD is a newly defined disease with no FDA-approved treatments. Our research addresses critical gaps: understanding why some patients relapse while others don\u2019t, comparing treatment effectiveness head-to-head, characterizing headache syndromes unique to MOGAD, and discovering how age shapes disease severity and treatment response. These studies directly inform clinical decisions for patients today.',
  NMOSD:
    'NMOSD can cause devastating attacks of blindness and paralysis. While three FDA-approved treatments now exist, we still don\u2019t know which works best for which patients. ANDOR is leading BEST-NMOSD, an international pragmatic clinical trial that directly compares treatments using a novel composite endpoint incorporating empirically determined thresholds for safety and tolerability failure\u2014providing the real-world evidence clinicians need.',
  'Autoimmune Encephalitis':
    'Autoimmune encephalitis can mimic psychiatric disease, leading to delayed or missed diagnoses. Many patients test negative for all known antibodies yet still respond to immunotherapy. Our research improves diagnostic pathways, defines seronegative encephalitis phenotypes, and evaluates new treatments through clinical trials\u2014ultimately getting patients the right diagnosis and treatment faster.',
  Neurosarcoidosis:
    'Neurosarcoidosis remains one of the most difficult neuroimmunological diagnoses to make and treat. There are no FDA-approved therapies, and most treatment decisions are based on limited evidence. Our research is uncovering the fundamental immune mechanisms driving nervous system sarcoidosis, working toward the first evidence-based treatment guidelines.',
  'CNS Vasculitis':
    'CNS vasculitis is rare, often devastating, and frequently requires brain biopsy for diagnosis. ANDOR maintains one of the world\u2019s largest biopsy-confirmed cohort databases, enabling us to define disease subtypes, identify prognostic markers, and develop less invasive diagnostic approaches\u2014critical steps toward improving outcomes for these underserved patients.',
  'EBV and MS':
    'Epstein-Barr virus is now recognized as a key trigger of multiple sclerosis, but the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Our laboratory bridges virology and neuroimmunology, investigating how EBV activates autoreactive immune cells, how viral particles traffic through exosomes, and whether antiviral strategies could prevent or treat MS\u2014potentially transforming the field.',
